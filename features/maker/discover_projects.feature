  In order to discover projects
  As a curator
  I want to trawl a Maker's feed for launch annoncements and links

  Scenario: Discovering Poke's projects from their Twitter feed
    Given a Maker with the following attributes:

      | feeds | http://twitter.com/pokelondon |
    When I run "discover_projects"
    Then it should return the following Projects:
